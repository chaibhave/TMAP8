For [software quality assurance](sqa/index.md) purposes, TMAP8 undergoes verification and validation. Verification consists of comparing TMAP8 predictions against analytical solutions in different conditions, which are often simple cases. Validation consists of comparing TMAP8 predictions against experimental data.

Note that in addition to monitoring TMAP8 performance and reproducibility in verification and validation cases, the effects of changes made to TMAP8 are tracked. A series of automated tests are performed via continuous integration using [CIVET](https://civet.inl.gov/repo/530) to help identify any changes in TMAP8's predictions, therefore ensuring stability and robustness. Before adding a new verification case, be sure that you are following the [verification standards](verification_standards.md)

TMAP8 also contains [example cases](examples/index.md), which showcase how TMAP8 can be used.
